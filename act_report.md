# Act Report

## Introduction

Purpose of this project was to go through the entire process of wrangling and analyzing a real-world source of data. This went from gathering and assessing the data, over cleaning it and visualize the insights in the end.

### Is there a correlation between the likes and interactions by other Twitter user?

As we can observe in the regplot that the oftener a photo got retweeted, the more likes it received. This effect acts surely also in the reverse way.

### How is the popularity of dog types distributed concerning tweet totals, favorite_count and retweet_count with the tweet?

The plots we can look at express an aspect of the early plot data with its linear regression model. The more tweets a dog breed received, the more retweets and likes it got.

The leading breed is the Golden Retriever in all three models.

When we look more closely and compare the Likes with the Tweet Counts model, we can see, for example, that not that many people tweet photos of the French Bulldog, but its ranking is indeed stronger in the Likes and Retweet Modell. This could mean few people own this breed but like it.

#### How does the time impact the tweet and like behaviours of the user?
How does the time impact the tweet and like behaviours of the user?

Checking the tweet behaviour over the months of the year web can clearly see that the wintry months of cold make the people tweet more photos.

I am astonished from the weekday view that the weekend is the least used time of the week to post photos.
